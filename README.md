This is a fantastic folder. It was created right after I finished learning Python basic syntax. Inside, it not only contains explanations of all Python basic syntax, but also includes highly detailed examples — and of course, I have written corresponding solution code for every single one of these examples. This folder is not only a record of my learning journey and efforts, but also an excellent learning tool. I hope readers can benefit from it.
